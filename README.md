# origin
this LaTeX-CV is based largely on Byungjin Park's excellent work. The original Awesome-CV can be found on his github: https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV

# changes
Some of the work, which I am not currently pulling upstream: 
- LuaLatex compatibility
- deactivated link hiding
- PhD (and similar name suffixes) by using nameDr{}{}{} instead of name{}{}
- additional cventries (long locations, simple references)
- skills in table-view
- simpler honors (2 instead of 3 fields)
- semi-anonymized CV template
